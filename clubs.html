          <br>Girls Who Code is an organization that encourages young women of all kinds to take on the challenge of programming. While students don't necessarily have to be in the Computer Science Academy in order to join Girls Who Code, it will significantly help them in keeping up and practicing. If a member of GWC is not in the CS Academy, they will have to be willing to put in extra work at home in order to code alongside their peers, so it is heavily encouraged that they join both. GWC gets together every Thursday and Friday from 2:30-4:00 p.m., brainstorming and executing new ideas and methods of programming.
