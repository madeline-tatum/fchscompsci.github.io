        <u>What is Computer Science at Fern Creek Like?</u>
      </h2>
        <p>
          This course gives students an opportunity to collaborate with their peers while building resilience, computational problem solving skills, and a comprehensive understanding of programming. This includes learning languages like Python, Javascript, and Swift. 
        </p>
      <h2>
        <u>CS Pathway</u>
      </h2>
      <p1>
        There are four courses that students of the Computer Science Academy at Fern Creek will take, each one spanning one year of their high school career.
      </p1>
      <h4>
        Freshman Year - Intro to Computer Science
      </h4>
      <center><img src="IMG_4121 (1).jpg" style="width:80%" class="p"></center>
      <p1>
         <br>Intro to Computer Science is the very basics of computer science. Although this is only an introduction to the world of computer science, it's still a challenging course that requires students to think about problems and come up with creative solutions. Throughout the year, students will focus on a variety of topics: problem solving, web developing, animations, design thinking, data and society, physical computing, and effectively communicating ideas with peers. Students will focus on developing these skills in order to become better problem solvers and think outside the box. 
      </p1>
      <h4>
        Sophomore Year - Computational Thinking
      </h4>
      <center><img src="IMG_7714.jpg" style="width:80%" class="p"></center>
      <p1>
        <br>Computational Thinking students will learn how to think like a programmer using the Python programming language.  By the end of the course, they will understand not only what they are doing with the language, but what the computer is doing because of them. <br> This course develops analytical thinking, and poses questions that the students will be attempting to answer throughout their entire careers. Complex problems lead to ambitious critical thinking. As Mr. Tennyson often says, "You have to be able to control your computer. Never let your computer control you."
      </p1>
      <h4>
        Junior Year - APCSP
      </h4>
      <p1>
        A Computer Science Principles(APCSP) will learn about Data structures and how they are impelmented. They will also use algorithmic analysis to expand upon ideas from the past year and help troubleshoot. APCPS will give the students an overview of computer science topics in the real world, such as big data, the Internet, and web development. Towards the end of the year students will be taking the AP test in Computer Science Principles, in order to gain college credit a student must optain a 4 out of 5 or higher. 
      </p1>
      <h4>
        Senior Year - Project Based Programming
      </h4>
      <p1>
        This project-based learning course engages those students with an entrepreneurial spirit that are interested in programming and in finding solutions to existing problems through the creation of applications. In this capstone course, students will create projects that require computer science fundamentals and extensive research to successfully complete. Students will work either solo or in a team in order to execute a project decided upon by the student(s). Students must demonstrate proficiency in time management, scope, research, computer science, and teamwork to be succcessful in this course.<br>
